# CS50 2020 - Lecture 0 - Scratch

I created these projects based on the tutorial       
[CS50 2020 - Lecture 0 - Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoXxevp1WRQ&ab_channel=CS50)

This is the Step B in my application to learn in **School of Code Bootcamp**:         
Bootcamp Application: Scratch Task Stage

After watching the lecture, I was able to create a Scratch project of my choice that fulfils these standard CS50 requirements:

✓ My project is a playable game.       
✓ My project takes the name of the user as input.      
✓ My project tracks the score.      
✓ My project has at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.      
✓ My project uses at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.      
✓ My project uses at least one sound.      
✓ My project is more complex than most of those demonstrated in the lecture.

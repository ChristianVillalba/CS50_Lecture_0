# CS50 2020 - Lecture 0 - Scratch

I created this project based on the tutorial       
[CS50 2020 - Lecture 0 - Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoXxevp1WRQ&ab_channel=CS50)

This is the Step B in my application to learn in **School of Code Bootcamp**:         
Bootcamp Application: Scratch Task Stage

## Description

After watching the lecture, I will able to create a Scratch project of my choice         
that fulfils these standard CS50 requirements:         
[Mark with ‚úì when a requirement is fufilled and tested]

‚ñ¢ My project is a playable game.       
‚ñ¢ My project takes the name of the user as input.      
‚ñ¢ My project tracks the score.      
‚ñ¢ My project has at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.      
‚ñ¢ My project uses at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.      
‚ñ¢ My project uses at least one sound.      
‚ñ¢ My project is more complex than most of those demonstrated in the lecture.      

## What I have learnt with this project
* Computers, transistors, and the Binary System
* Computers and represention of information:
  * Numerical values using the Binary System
  * Non-numerical values: from ASCII to Unicode
  * Colors: RGB system
  * Representation of images, videos and music
* Algorithms:
  * Definition: step by step instructions about how to solve problems 
  * Algorithm requirements: correct & precise
  * Aim: Algorithms strive for efficiency
* Pseudocode:
  * Definition: nn artificial and informal language that helps programmers develop algorithms.
  * Functions, Conditions, Booleans Expressions, Loops 
  * Transitions from pseudocode to actuall code
* Scratch üê±
